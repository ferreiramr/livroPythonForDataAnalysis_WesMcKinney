      "IPython offers a fully compatible replacement for the standard Python\n",

      "\n",
      "At your system command line, type 'ipython -h' to see the command line\n",

      "GETTING HELP\n",
      "------------\n",

      "Within IPython you have various way to access help:\n",
      "\n",
      "  ?         -> Introduction and overview of IPython's features (this screen).\n",

      "\n",
      "* System command aliases, via the %alias command or the configuration file(s).\n",
      "\n",
      "* Dynamic object information:\n",
      "\n",
      "  Typing ?word or word? prints detailed information about an object. Certain\n",
      "  long strings (code, etc.) get snipped in the center for brevity.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Typing ??word or word?? gives access to the full information without\n",
      "  snipping long strings. Strings that are longer than the screen are printed\n",
      "  through the less pager.\n",
      "\n",
      "  The ?/?? system gives access to the full source code for any object (if\n",
      "  available), shows function prototypes and other useful information.\n",
      "\n",
      "  If you just want to see an object's docstring, type '%pdoc object' (without\n",
      "  quotes, and without % if you have automagic on).\n",

      "* Tab completion in the local namespace:\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "* Search previous command history in multiple ways:\n",
      "\n",
      "  - Start typing, and then use arrow keys up/down or (Ctrl-p/Ctrl-n) to search\n",
      "    through the history items that match what you've typed so far.\n",
      "\n",
      "  - Hit Ctrl-r: opens a search prompt. Begin typing and the system searches\n",
      "    your history for lines that match what you've typed so far, completing as\n",
      "    much as it can.\n",
      "\n",
      "  - %hist: search history by index.\n",

      "\n",
      "* Verbose and colored exception traceback printouts. See the magic xmode and\n",
      "  xcolor functions for details (just type %magic).\n",
      "\n",
      "* Input caching system:\n",
      "\n",
      "  IPython offers numbered prompts (In/Out) with input and output caching. All\n",
      "  input is saved and can be retrieved as variables (besides the usual arrow\n",
      "  key recall).\n",
      "\n",

      "  _i: stores previous input.\n",

      "  _iii: next-next previous.\n",
      "  _ih : a list of all input _ih[n] is the input from line n.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Additionally, global variables named _i<n> are dynamically created (<n>\n",
      "  being the prompt counter), such that _i<n> == _ih[<n>]\n",
      "\n",
      "  For example, what you typed at prompt 14 is available as _i14 and _ih[14].\n",
      "\n",
      "  You can create macros which contain multiple input lines from this history,\n",
      "  for later re-execution, with the %macro function.\n",
      "\n",
      "  The history function %hist allows you to see any part of your input history\n",
      "  by printing a range of the _i variables. Note that inputs which contain\n",
      "  magic functions (%) appear in the history with a prepended comment. This is\n",
      "  because they aren't really valid Python code, so you can't exec them.\n",
      "\n",
      "* Output caching system:\n",
      "\n",
      "  For output that is returned from actions, a system similar to the input\n",
      "  cache exists but using _ instead of _i. Only actions that produce a result\n",
      "  (NOT assignments, for example) are cached. If you are familiar with\n",
      "  Mathematica, IPython's _ variables behave exactly like Mathematica's %\n",
      "  variables.\n",
      "\n",
      "  The following GLOBAL variables always exist (so don't overwrite them!):\n",
      "  _ (one underscore): previous output.\n",
      "  __ (two underscores): next previous.\n",
      "  ___ (three underscores): next-next previous.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Global variables named _<n> are dynamically created (<n> being the prompt\n",
      "  counter), such that the result of output <n> is always available as _<n>.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Finally, a global dictionary named _oh exists with entries for all lines\n",
      "  which generated output.\n",
      "\n",
      "* Directory history:\n",
      "\n",
      "  Your history of visited directories is kept in the global list _dh, and the\n",
      "  magic %cd command can be used to go to any entry in that list.\n",

This way, you\ncan set a break point, to step through the code from the point.\nYou can use this mode by giving statements to execute and optionally\na breakpoint.\n\nThe other one is to activate debugger in post-mortem mode.

Note that this will always work only on the last\ntraceback that occurred, so you must call this quickly after an\nexception that you wish to inspect has fired, because if another one\noccurs, it clobbers the previous one.\n\nIf you want IPython to automatically do this on every exception, see\nthe %pdb magic for more details.\n\n.. versionchanged:: 7.3\n    When running code, user variables are no longer expanded,\n    the magic line is always left unmodified.\n\npositional arguments:\n  statement             Code to run in debugger.
